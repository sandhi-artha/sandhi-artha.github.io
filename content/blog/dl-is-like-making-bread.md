When I just started my PhD on Deep Learning, I met a senior professor at an organization meeting. He was just there to drive his wife, not part of the organization. But since I sat next to him, might as well start a conversation. He was curious about my research, but when I said it's about Deep Learning, his tone seem suddenly provoking.

I knew the fundamentals and the works of neural networks, but I felt at that time, they were mostly recalling from memory instead of understanding. I could not convince him that it's a valid method of research and has limitations just like others. He blames DL for corrupting the academic research with low-quality papers. He said it's not research, what you do is trial and error, without proper hypothesis and you don't have theoretical proof of reliable models. I felt defeated, but there's definitely strong emotions from this person, that I knew he just wants to vent to someone, masking it as "academic discussion". I promised myself to learn more about keeping composure and proper methods of building a respectful discussion.


# It's an art

There are valid arguments to be made about proper ways to conduct DL research. But fast forward 3 semesters later, I was experimenting with making bread.

Then I thought: Hey, I just started learning how to make things out of flour, water and yeast. Even with just these 3 ingredients, there are many factors involved in getting food that u want to enjoy: room temp, proofing duration, water temperature, type of yeast, hydration ratio, how much kneading, baking temperature. Then of course, there's techniques that could affect the final shape and flavor, like how you scorch the dough, how you pop trapped air in the dough, spraying water when cooking to make steam that crisp the skin.

I think food recipes are the best metaphor for deep learning. It is empircal research. Sure you understand theoretically for example, that more yeast will speed up rising but risk overproofing, but the exact amount doesn't matter unless you set a consistent measurement for other important factors (as in a recipe). The way you find surprising flavor or shortcuts is by experimenting iteratively, learning from past mistakes, and make a generalization model based on your case (kitchen environment, cooking equipment, ingredients, skill). Your results will be different for other people and that's how a deep learning model would work differently for another dataset or different initializations.
