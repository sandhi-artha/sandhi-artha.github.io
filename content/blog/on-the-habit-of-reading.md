I used to enjoy reading novels. We can read slow and enjoy beautiful descriptions led by our imagination, or read fast as storyline progresses with tension building situations. Words from simple alphabetical symbols are an art, creating satisfaction, emotion, inspiring...

Now I'm doing a PhD. Most times, the last thing I want to do at the end of a "productive day" is to do another reading. I get easily sucked in to the lazy comfort of watching and shutting my brain dead. It's poison, and should be highly regulated.

Approximately mid way through my PhD, I become aware I mostly read long piece of text by skimming them. Reading parts of sentence, jumping 2-3 sentence ahead, looking for big words, locking on prominent numbers in between texts. Is this actually the best way? How did it happen?


### Too many papers out there
I remember in my first weeks of PhD, I tried to understand a single paper by reading it like a novel, from start to end. Didn't quite grasp it, I reread, draw some graphs of their methods, and made a full review of my understanding of it. That's quite a hassle, took a week for a single paper, and I still didn't understand half of it.

It's an experts job to keep up with the field, and boy, the topics of Machine Learning is not for the fainted hearts. Too many interesting findings to learn, too many noise to deal with. You can't survive by staying in the same spot for too long.


### Published papers have limited pages
They brush off some well-known facts, assuming the readers understand they're derivative work. They simply point out references if readers wish to learn more. This is extremely difficult when just starting out on a new field, reading core papers seems to be cryptic with jargons.

But as you progress, you'll remember core concepts, or at least repeating unidentified patterns, which hopefully will intrigue you to find more about it. With experience, you'll learn the "template" people used to write papers, and can quickly jump to areas where potentially the most important information lies.

# Books vs video tutorials

the thing about webinars, online course, is that it's video-based. it's good and it's bad. good bcz we feel like our hands are being held through the journey of learning. bad bcz sometimes we want to have our own learning path. so in summary, videos are good for beginners, but a hassle for intermediate/advanced

as you progress with a topic, you understand the basics and want to avoid the repetitive explanation about it. video lectures must atain to a generalized audience, you can't be too generous describing small details towards ppl who are unfamiliar, but also can't be too specific about a topic that adheres certain people. you also don't have time to talk about too much specific things, so you gotta balance it out somewhere.

this is inconvenient for someone seeking knowledge on how to do something when they are already familiar with steps to get there. instead of a quick in and out, you have to process the material sequentially, hoping you didn't miss any explanation. some ways to solve this is:
- timestamps/chapters
- a way to search a phrase througout the video (could be a dissertation topic!)

### in and out of a book
a book does not hold your hands. it's not meant to be read sequentially (except for story books). it's mostly text, therefore you can look up what you really want to know about quickly. however, the non-linear way of acquiring information means it's scary if you don't know your way in.

well, yeah, it depends on how the knowledge is presented. you could make a video lecture jumping  here and there. but good lectures are not like that, and you shouldn't spend too much time watching not so good lectures.

### it's scary
you've become aware enough to be picky on what information you consume. now, you just need to get past the fear of being stupid. it's not like you could understand everything. sometimes it's worth going through a sub-chapter in a book/article about what you're looking for to get an overview. if you stop each sentence bcz you found a new term, it's going to be a long and unmotivating process
